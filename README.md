# Erosion
A WorldPainter Script that simulates fluvial and thermal erosion using cellular automata.

Run without any parameters to get help.

Right now, the script is slow and inaccurate. The global parameters need to be edited in order to yield better results.

This script was possible thanks to these two papers:
"Fast Hydraulic Erosion Simulation and Visualization on GPU" by Xing Mei, Philippe Decaudin, Bao-Gang Hu
"Fast Hydraulic and Thermal Erosion on the GPU" by Balazs Jako
